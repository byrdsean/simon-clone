# simon-clone

The game "Simon" written in React, Javascript and CSS.

## Purpose of building this project

I wanted to teach myself React using functional components. Writing a game is a good way to learn React and practice implementing game logic.

## What did I learn

1. How to create a react app from the baseline `create-react-app` project.
2. Structuring the game logic into multiple functional components.
3. Separate styling into multiple files for each component.
4. Handling state across multiple React components.
